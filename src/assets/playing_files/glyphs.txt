The ancient stone door looms before you, its surface adorned with intricate glyphs that pulse faintly with a golden glow. As you examine the symbols, you notice they form a patternâ€”a geometric riddle waiting to be solved.

A line of text appears at the bottom of the door, written in an ancient script:

"To unlock this gate, prove your wisdom. Calculate the total area of the six sacred sides. Use the key of mathematics to reveal the truth."

Beneath the text, you find a smaller inscription, seemingly a hint:

"The sacred hexagon holds secrets untold. Its side length measures three."

Hint File for Stage 2: Deadly Traps Maze

General Hints:
1.  Maze Scan and Traps
   - The maze contains traps such as Dart Traps, Pressure Plates, and Fire Jets.
   - Each trap requires a specific action to disable or bypass.

2.  Disarm Dart Trap 
   - Use an `if-else` structure to test wire connections and decide which wire to cut.
   - Example:
     ```
     if [[ $voltage -lt 5 ]]; then
         echo "Cut the red wire."
     else
         echo "Cut the blue wire."
     fi
     ```
   - Replace `voltage` with the condition provided in the task.

3.  Solve Pressure Plate Puzzle 
   - Use a `for` loop to press the plates in the correct sequence (1, 3, 5).
   - Example:
     ```
     for i in 1 3 5; do
         echo "Pressing plate $i"
     done
     ```
   - Ensure the sequence matches the task requirements.

4.  Navigate Fire Jets 
   - Use a `case` statement to determine the safest time to cross.
   - Example:
     ```
     case $timing in
         "safe")
             echo "Cross now."
             ;;
         "danger")
             echo "Wait."
             ;;
     esac
     ```
   - Replace `timing` with the input or condition specified.

5.  Decode Cryptic Map 
   - The map provides a binary pattern (e.g., 1101).
   - Use an `if` statement to match the binary and decode it.
   - Example:
     ```
     if [[ $binary == "1101" ]]; then
         echo "Decoding successful."
     fi
     ```

Survival Task:
1.  Escape the Pit 
   - Combine available items (e.g., rope, wooden planks, metal hooks) to construct a ladder.
   - The correct combination is:
     ```
     rope+wooden planks+metal hooks
     ```
   - Type this combination to escape successfully.

2.  Attempts and Mistakes 
   - You have a maximum of 2 attempts to solve the survival task.
   - Plan your actions carefully to avoid failure.

Debugging Tips:
- Use `echo` to test your logic and variable values.
- Check for syntax errors, especially in loops and conditional statements.
- Revisit the task descriptions to ensure your solution matches the requirements.

Strategies to Win:
- Carefully read the task descriptions and provided hints.
- Write scripts incrementally and test each step.
- Use hints effectively to avoid mistakes.
- Prioritize survival task if triggered and ensure correct input.

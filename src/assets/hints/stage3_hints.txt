Hint File for Stage 3: Mysterious Inscriptions Chamber

General Hints:
1.  Translating Glyphs 
   - Use a `for` loop to calculate and store doubled values for numbers from 1 to 5.
   - Example:
     ```
     for i in {1..5}; do
         echo $((i * 2))
     done
     ```
   - Ensure your input matches the required output format (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

2.  Operating the Mechanism 
   - Balance the machine power level between 5 and 10.
   - Use the `add` and `subtract` commands to adjust power incrementally.
   - Example:
     ```
     power=0
     power=$((power + 3))  # Adding to power
     power=$((power - 2))  # Subtracting from power
     ```
   - Continuously check the power level to ensure it stays within the range.

3.  Solving the Logic Puzzle 
   - Match glyph fragments (e.g., "Sun") to their meanings (e.g., "Day").
   - Use a loop to process each fragment and validate the match.
   - Example:
     ```
     fragments=("Sun" "Moon")
     meanings=("Day" "Night")
     for ((i = 0; i < ${#fragments[@]}; i++)); do
         echo "Fragment: ${fragments[i]} Meaning: ${meanings[i]}"
     done
     ```

4.  Survival Task 
   - If the chamber starts flooding, repair the pump by processing all files (e.g., `pipe1.txt`).
   - Use a loop to iterate through the files and simulate repair:
     ```
     files=("pipe1.txt" "pipe2.txt")
     for file in "${files[@]}"; do
         echo "Repairing $file..."
         sleep 1
     done
     ```
   - Combine survival attempts effectively to avoid triggering game over.

Debugging Tips:
- Print variables using `echo` to verify their values.
- Use simple test cases for logic and loop structures before implementing the full solution.
- Ensure your script outputs match the task requirements.

Strategies to Win:
- Double-check loop logic to avoid infinite loops or incorrect outputs.
- Minimize mistakes by validating inputs and intermediate results.
- Pay close attention to task instructions and implement them step-by-step.
- If the survival task is triggered, focus on completing it within the allowed attempts.

Hint File for Stage 5: The Hidden Chamber

General Hints:
1. Understand Array Basics
   - Learn how to create an array in Bash using `arr=(value1 value2 ...)`.
   - Familiarize yourself with array indices and referencing using `${arr[index]}`.

2. Iterating Through Arrays
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through all elements in the array.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     for item in "${arr[@]}"; do
         echo "$item"
     done
     ```

3. Filtering Arrays
   - Use conditional statements within loops to filter specific elements.
   - Example: Filter even numbers
     ```bash
     for item in "${arr[@]}"; do
         if (( item % 2 == 0 )); then
             even_arr+=("$item")
         fi
     done
     ```

4. Pattern Matching
   - Use conditional checks to match patterns in arrays, e.g., finding a specific number.
   - Example: Find number 7
     ```bash
     for item in "${arr[@]}"; do
         if [[ $item -eq 7 ]]; then
             echo "Found 7!"
         fi
     done
     ```

5. Survival Challenge Tips
   - Read lines from a file using a `while read` loop.
   - Example: Process each gap in 'gaps.txt'
     ```bash
     while read gap; do
         echo "Bridging $gap"
     done < gaps.txt
     ```

Debugging Tips:
- Use `echo` statements to print variables and arrays for debugging.
- Run small parts of your script independently to ensure correctness.
- Verify array contents with `echo "${arr[@]}"`.

Strategies to Win:
- Break tasks into smaller steps and test them individually.
- Minimize mistakes by double-checking syntax and logic.
- Understand and fix mistakes early to avoid triggering the survival challenge.

Hint File for Stage 6: Temple Collapse Escape

General Hints:
1. Carefully read through the escape_routes.txt file.
   - Look for lines containing the word "safe" to identify a possible escape route.
   - If the file is missing, you will need to handle this error gracefully.

2. Pay attention to the paths you validate.
   - Use the 'validate_path' function to check if directories or files exist.
   - Ensure all required files and directories are in place to avoid mistakes.

3. Codex Fragments:
   - Make sure all 8 fragments (fragment_*.txt) are available.
   - Use the 'cat' command to combine them into 'Codex_of_Computis.txt'.
   - If any fragments are missing, identify how many are needed and avoid exceeding the maximum mistake limit.

4. Survival Task:
   - If too many mistakes are made, you'll need to clear debris files (debris_*.txt).
   - Ensure all debris files are removed successfully to proceed.
   - Failing to clear debris after two attempts will result in failure.

Debugging Tips:
- Use 'echo' statements to print out variable values for debugging.
- Check log files (e.g., escape_progress.log) for detailed progress updates.
- Review the structure and contents of the directory before running the script.

Specific Commands to Verify Setup:
1. Ensure the escape routes file exists:
   ls -l escape_routes.txt

2. Check for the presence of all Codex fragments:
   ls -l fragment_*.txt

3. Validate that debris files are in the correct format:
   ls -l debris_*.txt

Strategies to Win:
- Avoid unnecessary mistakes by validating files and paths before proceeding.
- Complete each task in the specified order to ensure no steps are missed.
- Use logs to track progress and identify errors early.

Hint File for Stage 1: Temple Entrance - Puzzle Locks

General Hints:
1.  Reading Glyphs 
   - Use the `cat` command to read the contents of the glyphs file.
   - Example:
     ```
     cat glyphs.txt
     ```
   - This will reveal the symbols and patterns needed to solve the puzzle.

2.  Calculating the Area of a Hexagon 
   - The formula to calculate the area of a hexagon is:
     ```
     Area = \( \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot a^2 \)
     ```
     where `a` is the side length of the hexagon.
   - Define a variable for the side length (e.g., `a=3`).
   - Use `bc -l` for precise calculations involving square roots and fractions.
   - Example:
     ```
     echo "(3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * ($a * $a)" | bc -l
     ```

3.  Understanding Mistakes and Hints 
   - Mistakes are tracked, and you have a maximum of 5 attempts before triggering the survival task.
   - After 2 mistakes:
     - Hint: The area of a hexagon can be calculated by dividing it into six equilateral triangles.
   - After 4 mistakes:
     - Hint: Use `sqrt()` within `bc` for square root calculations.

4.  Survival Task 
   - If you trigger the survival task, you must calculate escape timing.
   - Use the given formula:
     ```
     time = distance / speed
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     echo "scale=2; 50 / 20" | bc
     ```
   - This calculates the time required to reach safety with a precision of two decimal places.

Debugging Tips:
- Use `echo` to verify the values of variables and calculations.
- Ensure commands are typed correctly to avoid unnecessary mistakes.
- Revisit the glyphs and formula if needed to double-check your work.

Strategies to Win:
- Read all instructions and hints carefully.
- Define variables and use them effectively in calculations.
- Avoid rushing through the tasks to minimize mistakes.
- Solve the survival task promptly if it is triggered.

Hint File for Stage 4: Artifact Fragment Collection

General Hints:
1.  Trap Disabling 
   - Understand the types of traps and how to disable them.
   - Dart Traps:
     - Use a logical approach to "cut wires" or similar tasks.
   - Pressure Traps:
     - Carefully remove weights in a balanced manner.
   - If you encounter an unknown trap type, ensure you handle the error gracefully.

2.  Solving the Riddle 
   - The riddle asks: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"
   - Think about natural phenomena or abstract concepts. The answer is "echo".

3.  Symbol Matching 
   - You are given a sequence of symbols to match: âš¡, âœ¨, ðŸ”’.
   - Ensure you enter the symbols in the exact order, separated by commas.
   - Example:
     ```
     âš¡,âœ¨,ðŸ”’
     ```

4.  Stabilizing the Ceiling 
   - You must combine available resources to construct supports.
   - The correct combination is "wood+rope+metal rods".
   - Ensure all resources are included and in the correct format.

Debugging Tips:
- Use `echo` to print variables and ensure your input matches the expected format.
- Revisit logic for traps and puzzles if you encounter errors.
- If survival tasks are triggered, carefully follow instructions to avoid game over.

Strategies to Win:
- Read all instructions carefully before answering or solving tasks.
- Minimize mistakes by double-checking inputs.
- Handle errors gracefully to avoid the survival challenge.
- Use available resources effectively to stabilize the ceiling if necessary.

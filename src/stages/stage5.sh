# Stage 5: The Hidden Chamber
# Players begin exploring the temple and using the commands they've learned.
# Educational Focus: Array Manipulation
# Scenario:
# A grand hall greets you, its floor a mosaic of shifting tiles. Each tile corresponds to a specific sequence or pattern. Terminals across the hall require you to manipulate arrays to align the tiles and open the final passage.

# Goal:
# Use array operations to solve puzzles and progress.

# Tasks:

# Create and populate arrays with patterns.
# Iterate through arrays to find specific combinations.
# Perform complex manipulations to unlock the passage.
# Tasks:

# Create and populate arrays with given sequences.
# Iterate through arrays to find and align matching tiles.
# Perform advanced array manipulations to solve a multi-part puzzle.
# Use arrays to unlock a hidden room containing a Codex fragment.
# Survival Task: The hall's floor collapses into a chasm. Write a script to bridge gaps by iterating through a file containing structural configurations.
# Outcomes:

# Align the hall, find 1-2 Codex fragments, and uncover a shortcut for Stage 6.
# Fail Survival Task: Fall into the chasm.

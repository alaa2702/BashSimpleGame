# Stage 1: The Entry Chamber
# Players begin exploring the temple and using the commands they've learned.
# Stage 6: Temple Collapse Escape
# Educational Focus: File Operations and System Interactions
# Scenario:
# With the Codex of Computis in hand, the temple begins to collapse. The ground shakes, walls crack, and debris falls. A final terminal near the exit requires you to perform file operations and system interactions to escape safely.

# Goal:
# Master file operations to find the fastest and safest route out of the temple.

# Challenges:

# Read configuration files to identify escape routes.
# Write progress logs to track actions during the escape.
# Check for the existence of files and directories to navigate effectively.
# Tasks:

# Read configuration files to locate escape routes.
# Write progress logs for the escape sequence.
# Check file and directory existence to access the safest paths.
# Combine Codex fragments using a Bash script (if all 8 were collected).
# Survival Task: Navigate a collapsing tunnel by creating symbolic links to the correct directories.
# Outcomes:

# Complete Success: Escape with all 8 Codex fragments and unlock its full power.
# Partial Success: Escape with fewer fragments, leaving the artifact incomplete.
# Survival Escape: Barely escape, leaving the Codex behind.
# Mission Failure: Fail Survival Taskâ€”trapped in the temple forever.

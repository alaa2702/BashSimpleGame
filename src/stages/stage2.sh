# Stage 2: Deadly traps Maze
#Educational Focus: Conditional Statements and Logic
# Scenario:
# Beyond the door lies a dark maze, its walls adorned with flickering torches. The air is thick with dangerâ€”lethal traps lurk at every turn, waiting to punish poor decisions. A terminal near the entrance hints that conditional logic is the key to navigating the maze.
# Goal:
# Use conditional statements (if-else, case) to avoid traps and choose safe paths through the maze.

# Challenges:

# Identify and disable traps using tools.
# Choose the correct paths based on logical conditions.
# Make quick decisions under time pressure to avoid penalties or injuries.
# Tasks:

# Use if-else statements to disable a dart trap.
# Solve a multi-path challenge using case statements.
# Use logic to open a safe path, preserving a limited-use tool for later.
# Decode a cryptic map using a condition-based script.
# Survival Task: Trigger a trapdoor, falling into a pit. Write a script to construct a makeshift ladder using resource files (inventory items).
# Outcomes:

# Navigate safely with 1-2 Codex fragments and tools for later.
# Lose health from partial trap failures.
# Fail Survival Task: Fall into the abyss.

# Stage 1: Temple Entrance - Puzzle Locks
# Educational Focus: Variable Declaration and Manipulation

# Scenario:
# You stand before an enormous stone door covered in intricate geometric patterns. Next to it lies a terminal-like device inscribed with ancient text. The door wonâ€™t budge unless you solve its puzzle by manipulating variables and performing symbolic calculations.

# Goal:
# Master variable declaration and basic arithmetic operations to solve the puzzles and open the door.

# Tasks:

# Declare and manipulate variables to solve mathematical and symbolic puzzles.
# Experiment with different approaches to find the correct solution.
# Reset the puzzle if necessary to avoid penalties.
#Survival Task: The door mechanism malfunctions, triggering a falling stone trap. Write a quick script to calculate escape timing using arithmetic and display results in seconds.
# Outcomes:

# Open the door and find 1-2 Codex fragments.
# Learn a key pattern for the glyphs in Stage 3.
# Fail Survival Task: Crushed by falling stones.

# Stage 3: Mysterious Inscriptions Chamber
# Educational Focus: Loop Structures
# Scenario:
# You enter a vast chamber where walls are inscribed with glyphs and mechanical contraptions. A glowing terminal hints that the glyphs are part of a puzzle. Using loops (for, while), you must decipher the symbols and operate the mechanisms to reveal crucial information about the templeâ€™s history.

# Goal:
# Master loop structures to repeat actions and process collections of data.

# Tasks:

# Translate glyphs using hints and fragments collected so far.
# Use loops to solve mechanical puzzles involving repeated patterns.
# Break and continue loops to optimize your solutions.
# Tasks:

# Use a for loop to translate glyphs based on provided clues.
# Operate a machine using a while loop to repeat actions until a condition is met.
# Use a loop to iterate through and match glyph fragments to their meanings.
# Experiment with break and continue in a logic-based contraption puzzle.
# Survival Task: Trigger a glyph's protective mechanism, which floods the chamber. Write a loop to simulate repairing a pump by processing files.
# Outcomes:

# Translate critical glyphs and collect 1-2 Codex fragments.
# Discover a hint for Stage 5's puzzles.
# Fail Survival Task: Drown in the flooded chamber.
